# MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline Bug
This repository demonstrates a common error in MongoDB aggregation pipelines: incorrect use of the $group stage. The provided code snippet shows an aggregation pipeline where the $sum operator is applied to a non-numeric field, leading to incorrect results.

## Bug Description
The $group stage attempts to sum a non-numeric field, resulting in unexpected aggregation outputs. The pipeline filters documents, groups them by a field, and then sums values from another field within each group. However, if this 'anotherField' isn't a numeric type the aggregation fails silently and returns the wrong result.

## Solution
The corrected pipeline ensures that the field used in the $sum operator is of a numeric type. This is accomplished by either explicitly casting the field to a numeric type or by ensuring that the data in this field is already numeric in the MongoDB collection.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone the repository.
2. Create a MongoDB collection with sample data.
3. Run the buggy aggregation pipeline (bug.js) and observe the incorrect results.
4. Run the corrected aggregation pipeline (bugSolution.js) and observe the accurate results.
